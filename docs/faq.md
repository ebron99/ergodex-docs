# FAQ

1. Question: I performed a swap but my funds didn't immediately show up in my wallet?

   Answer: Wait a few minutes, all transactions have to be verified on the blockchain. The Ergo blockchain has an average block time of 2 minutes.

2. Question: I waited a while and the funds still didn't show up in my wallet?
   
   Answer: In the DEX, click on the "recent transactios" icon in the top right corner. View your transaction status, if the status is "locked", this usually means your transaction failed because of slippsge. click "refund" to reverse the transaction, and you can try again, this time try using higher slippage tolerance.

3. Question: I just minted my own token, how do I add an icon to the Dex for it?
   
   Answer: Create your token icon in a .SVG file and create a pull request to the icons gihub repository here: https://github.com/spectrum-finance/ergo-dex-asset-icons

4. Question: I want my Token to appear on list of default Dex tokens without having to import the icon, how do I do that?
   
   Answer: To have your Token appear on the default list, create a "Token Request Issue" here: https://github.com/spectrum-finance/default-token-list

5. Question: I heard Spectrum Finance is really ErgoDex?
   
   Answer: When we first launched we were called "ErgoDex", but that caused confustion to our audience. We rebranded to "Spectrum Finance" to let users know that i)We are a dex for Cardano, Ergo, and possibly other chains in the future & ii) We are a separate entity/project from Ergo Foundation and Ergo Core Developers.
